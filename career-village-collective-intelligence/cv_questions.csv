<pre><code> My name is Keanu Moore and I am a junior at Democracy Prep Charter School in Harlem. I aspire to be a lawyer when I ""grow up"" and later pursue a career in politics. 
 As college has become more of a reality for me as the months and years go by, I've been seriously looking at institutions that would fit me best. I've scoped out colleges like City College in my neighborhood to schools like Harvard and Yale. My father and stepmother have had several conversations with me about college, and my father even suggested the United States Air Force Academy as an option. They stress that, even in a down economy like the current one, now more than ever before  college graduates are having a hard time finding a job. They explain that this is especially true for law jobs, as there was a glut in th elegal industry in the 1980s and 1990s. 
 As a professional in this industry, I was wondering what you think about the current job market for lawyers and how I can best navigate in it.
 Pleasure to make your aquaintance.

7794,I'm graduating from college in a few months with a 2.6 GPA in Bachelor of Arts in Biology. I've decided to try to go to Nursing School at this point. What should I do to increase my chances of getting in? Is it likely that I would be accepted?,"<p>When I graduated from high school I set my goal to go into dentistry. Throughout my undergraduate years I've struggled with keeping my grades up. The main reason why is because after seeing how much I struggled with just passing my first semester of college, I immediately started doubting that I was smart enough to make the right decisions as a doctor, learn fast enough to get through school, or even be competitive enough to get accepted. After my second semester as a freshman I was sure of it (after doing so bad in General Chemistry) and changed all of my classes for the next semester to basics so I could change my major and do something else. But as I was looking at different majors I felt guilty of leaving Natural Sciences not because I wasn't interested in it (which I definitely am) just because I thought it was too hard; and all of my friends and family were persuading me to stay in and just work harder. So I decided to be more optimistic and stay in. Things got a little better, I was studying more and being more optimistic but my grades were never where they needed to be. And after awhile of telling myself ""This semester I'm going to get awesome grades!"" and then ending the semester with B's and C's I started to feel like a failure. So the motivation to keep trying soon dwindled down to just trying to graduate on time, which is why my final GPA is going to be so bad. Anyway, after talking to my significant other (who is doing awesome in school and is going to med school; succeeding in everything I planned to do with great ease) I realized that it's not that I'm stupid, I just keep doubting myself and letting the success of others make me feel inadequate. And to be honest I've never actually studied as hard as humanly possible to get my grades up and I've never actually failed a class which says a lot about how I don't know my true potential. And most of all, I don't have any motivation because I lost track of my goal. So I'm ending my undergraduate career with a goal in mind to get into nursing school (my Plan B just in case Dentistry didn't work out). Because my GPA is so low, I know I'm going to have to take a year or two off to become more competitive (getting in some shadowing or an internship and taking extra classes at a community college to improve my GPA) But does anyone have any advice on what I specifically need to do? Or should I even try to make this happen?  Or maybe just some advice on how to stay mentally strong when I feel doubt?</p>",higher-education counselling nursing registered-nurses,4839,2015-01-09 15:28:11.077088

I live in Canada, and I really want to get into an American University, but the chances are slim due to my lack of opinion on what career I really want. In school, I am doing well in math, and science. However, I know I can go into science if I wanted to, but my parents are urging me to go into business. Sometimes they tell me to go into law as well. Right now, I am honestly so confused with what kind of a career path I should be taking. Right now, course selections for grade 11 is happening, and they have a direct impact on the courses I will take in university, or what university programs I will get in. I currently chose: English, Math, Bio, Chem, Physics, Music, Music 2, Harmony, Canadian Law. I am also considering taking AP classes because apparently American universities look favourably at that.

Being a girl myself, I rarely see as many successful female architects compared to male ones, so that might be another disadvantage as well. Oh, and architecture is also not really famous in my country, so there might not be much job opportunities available. Is there any other course related to design and science?

I want a job that's not related to numbers or maths, and where I can communicate and socialize with people, and go to different places.

I am just trying to get some feedback if anyone has had a relationship that worked while you were away for so long?</p>

I originally wanted to go to med school but I took the MCAT and I did not do good plus my gpa is only 3.1. So, I was looking to get into any nursing program but I missed two classes so now I'm enrolled as a non seeking student taking those two classes, however the university that I applied called me this week to tell me that I may need another class to get into. I really want to move forward without wasting anymore time, so since lab has been always very interesting for me too I decided to change my plans. I am thinking to apply to a master program but I am afraid it just delay the problem 2 more years. I have been thinking that maybe I should get some experience before doing a master but I have sent over 30 resume to different labs and companies an nothing happens. I am really worried because thanks to the lack of information over my undergraduate career I graduated with zero research experience, so it is hard for me to find a job. Recently, a friend told me about getting a certification as medical lab technician or histotechnology, but I feel that those career colleges are not very reliable and accredited so im afraid to waste time and money.
Right now I am working as a receptionist but obviously I am earning just 9.5/hour and is not enough to paid my loans and move from my home. At this point I am really frustrated and depressed, I feel that my degree is worthless but still I love biology and I would like to develop my career in that field I just do not know what to do or what route to take.

If another field office needs them, then they are transferred to a different one. I also am aware that FBI agents can specialize in different types of fields. For example, cyber and or criminal justice. I have heard that FBI agents also have a lot of paperwork, and very long shifts. I do speak fluent Spanish, so isn't that supposed to exempt me from the three years of professional work experience as well?

<p>Hello everyone who looks into this page. I am Alex and next year I'll be finishing high-school. The traditional 12 year grid if you will :D. It is a really confusing time for me now, because I should already know what I'm going to do after finishing school and where I'm going to do it, but unfortunately I don't... At least not entirely.</p>
<p>For about 4 years now I've been really into writing stories and making games, it is a big passion of mine so a thought crossed my mind that I would feel truly happy if I could do that for a living, not just as a hobby. I've been working with easy-to-use programs such as RPG maker XP and VX and even now I am working on releasing a visual novel, so I think it's clear that it's not something I came up with just because I played a really good game or just because I think it's easy. I am well aware that it's a hard,  long and challenging process, but despite that, I still wanna do it.</p>
<p>It would mean a world to me if someone could give me tips how to achieve this goal... What kind of college or university should I try to join? What's the first step towards this? And perhaps if I'm really lucky I could even talk privately with someone working in the video game industry... Being from a small country in EU I have no family or friends who are in this field so I am completely blind. And yes, I am ready to start at the very bottom. Heck, I could even wash toilets as long as there is a chance for a promotion into writing a story line, designing ""character's character"" and quests.</p>
<p>I hope this reaches someone that is willing to assist me and thank you in advance!</p>",career-paths career design video-game game,1023,2013-04-14 03:03:43.050721

14745,I realized I strongly dislike my major. What should I do?,"<p>I started college three years ago as an Architecture major (my program is 5 years long). I dreamed to be an architect since I was around 8 years old, so I thought it would my ideal college major... but even after three weeks into my freshman year I realized it wasn't what I really wanted. My parents told me to finish freshman year because maybe I would actually like it. I finished that year and I still didn't liked it, but my parents basically forced me to keep going. Now that I'm already halfway through it, I realized I hate it (so much that, from being in the Dean's list, now I'm in the list of students on academic probation). I'd rather work as a cashier than doing this all my life. Obviously, my parents are not keen with the idea of me dropping out (They told me if I do it, they would disown me and I would be dead for them). Because of all this, I've been battling moderate depression and severe anxiety this last 4 months. I know the semester is almost over (I start finals tomorrow and have no idea of what I will do, because I can't even study without feeling bad). In all this time, the only classes I've actually liked are the ones related to writing and to history. So I told my parents that I want to change majors, and either be an English major or an Art History one. They told me those degrees were worthless (As much as Architecture I guess...) and that I'm immature and stupid for even thinking about it. I guess I gave them so much hope as a child (I skipped 2 grades, used to be a spelling be and participate in math decathlons), that when I chose Architecture as my major they were a little disappointed and now that I want to change it, I've disappointed them a lot more. So, what do you think I should do? Should I drop out/change majors? or should I get my degree in Architecture?</p>",choosing-a-major majors architect english,8843,2015-12-14 00:42:01.147776

I was thinking (actually my mom and I) of taking this course since my mom said that it was in demand, it suited my talents and skills, and it is a specific field in law. My concern is that I wouldn't be able to find a job after completion of the course and the only way I can study law is by supporting myself.</p>
<p>I have already checked on school websites that provide the course and the said job opportunities, however universities only say that because they provide the course and need students to take it. People who finish 'unique' courses rarely get jobs right away because other individuals are highly professional in those fields, leaving the newbies no hope (truth be told).</p>
<p>I am also aware that finding a job is not easy and everybody starts off from below, however if I'm going to end up that way until I reach the age of 30 (because of the course I took), I'd totally regret taking the course.</p>

<p>Who am I?  Someone who has dreamed about whats in outer space, but currently, I am a College student who will be graduating this semester with a B.S. Degree in Economics and a minor in Psychology (~3.23 cumulative g.p.a.).  Though, I could have graduated last semester I decided to stay an extra semester and pursue an interest I have in a Engineering/Science degree.  I did this by studying Mechanical Engineering because it appears very versatile, though I was close to choosing astrophysics (Seems like for astrophysics, it would take at least 20 years to get where you would want to be).  The purpose of this would be to eventually allow me to work somewhere in the space industry.  I would greatly enjoy assisting government or third party space companies/programs develop (i.e. NASA, Space X, Deep Space Industries, or Planetary Resources).</p>
<p>The Dilemma, it would take another 6 semesters (3 years) of hard work and money to finish this second B.S. degree and I am not so sure it would get me any closer to my dream job.  I have been contemplating earning a PhD in economics and try to help that way (I do have some research ideas and would not mind teaching), but it would take at least another 7 years of school and I am not even sure I could get in or could afford it because my g.p.a. of ~3.23 is low for even getting accepted to grad school. I think I have summed up my problem well, but if there is anything relevant that could help you, help me feel free to ask.  Thank you again for your help!

2969,How does Going to College Serve a Person today?,"<p>Exactly why do we go to college? For the average Joe, Besides having to practically pay their ENTIRE yearly income to attend to college, how does that shiny certificate help you in the future? Exactly how does that separate you from THOUSANDS of OTHER applicants shooting for the same job. To put on top of that, if you want to go to a specialist field, you have to attend a Graduate school for 6 years to obtain a Masters degree(Which is now becoming the BARE MINIMUM to get a job). Then by the time you are in your mid twenties, you may get a mediocre job at 80 thousand dollars a year IF you are lucky. Now although that is two times the American average wage, you end up paying for your taxes and possibly your student loans you may have received to pay for college. I'm asking this question because I'm aware of many friends who don't have degrees and yet find themselves in promising start-ups and importing businesses. At the same time, I also know many others who have Masters degrees but struggle in securing jobs to support themselves.

<p>I am currently a high school junior with big dreams but little to no influence on society at the moment. After years of Cross Country running, amateur competitive boxing, and staying fit and healthy in general, I have come to espouse health &amp; fitness as a lifestyle. Currently, most of what I do now is strength training and bodybuilding, all of which have taught me a lot about myself which I try to spread through a health &amp; fitness club I started at my high school. A champion bodybuilder of his time and a professional in disease control, Eugen Sandow, wrote a book called Life is Movement over a hundred years ago in order to voice his thoughts on the increasing maladies in our world. Sandow makes connections such as how if the government and youth were more well-informed in what made someone a truly healthy being which includes knowing which foods should be eaten and how to exercise properly then everyone would be strong enough holistically to prevent disease without the dependence on medicine. I have dreams of becoming a physician since I love helping people out and knowing more about the human body. Would I have enough power as a physician to influence the world in the way I want? How can I go about this large goal when I am a physician? What will support me? </p>

I struggle a lot with physics, but my chemistry and biology grades are a lot better. Based only on my academics, I was wondering if anyone could tell if I would do well with a career in medicine. If yes, are there any specific career options that I should look into more? And if not, do you have any suggestions or advice on what you think I would do well in? (Of course, there are other things I have to consider when looking into a career, such as interest and education level and stuff like that, but for now, I simply want to get an idea of where I should begin looking.)</p>
<p>In addition, it would be wonderful if you could include extra classes I should take, such as which foreign language I should take, which electives would be nice for this career pathway, etc. Thanks for any help!</p>",high-school career science classes college medicine,7103,2015-08-21 09:43:44.852881

I'm majoring in chemistry and minoring in film studies in hopes of attending medical school to further my studies. The overall dream is to become a doctor, it's what I love. Ever since I was a kid I knew it's what I wanted to do with my life. My other passion is comedy and acting. I have preformed stand up comedy a few times now and can safely say I want to do this for the rest of my life. I don't expect to become for a better lack of a word ""famous"" but I would love to act in plays or a tv show or something like that. The problem is could it hurt my chances of becoming a doctor. Some might say I have a dirty/foul mouth. I can't help it. I'm honest I guess. I post stuff on the Internet. Could a future employer come across some of my creative work that they would find offensive and not hire me? Could they fire me? Does it hurt my chances? Do I pick one or the other?
